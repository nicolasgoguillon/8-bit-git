NOTE #1

--------------------

Dear $User,

By the time you read this, BSOD will have already locked me away in the cursed dungeon remote branch. But no fear, you have been granted the powers of Git. The first thing to do is find out where you are. Type:

git status

Currently, you are on the master branch. You should see "On branch master" and more output. To find out additional local branches, type:

git branch

There should be none, as you haven't created any. However, if you type:


git branch -a

You should see a few remote branches from the origin, one called "backup" and one called "cursed_dungeon". Switch to the "backup" branch by typing:

git checkout backup

Once on this different branch, you will have access to the backup Palace and an updated note from me.

Good luck!

NOTE #2

--------------------

Dear $User,

You've made it to the backup branch! Type the following to check:

git status

If you check out the "Bit Palace" directory, you'll see a complete bit-palace. Type the two following commands

cd bit_palace
cat bit_palace.txt

To return to the previous directory:

cd ..

Now, you'll need to restore the palace by merging the "backup" branch to the "master" branch. You'll need to 

git checkout master
git merge backup

Before you do that, here's the secret code that will allow you to pull the master_sword out of master_sword_in_stone.zip. The code is "versioncontrol". The command to pull the sword out is 

unzip master_sword_in_stone.zip

Now return to the master branch and merge the backup to restore the palace. Good luck!

P.S. After restoring the palace, you'll want to visit the "cursed_dungeon" branch. Re-read this note if you need help with "checking out" that branch ;
